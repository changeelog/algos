package stoogesort


/*
Stooge Sort is a recursive sorting algorithm with a unique approach.
It divides the array into three parts and recursively sorts the first 2/3,
then the last 2/3, and finally the first 2/3 again.

See [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stooge_sort)

Visual representation of the process:

    (5)---(2)---(8)---(1)---(9)---(3)
     |     |     |     |     |     |
     |     |     |     |     |     |
    (2)---(5)---(8)---(1)---(9)---(3)
     |           |           |
     |           |           |
    (2)---(5)---(1)---(8)---(9)---(3)
     |     |     |     |     |     |
     |     |     |     |     |     |
    (1)---(2)---(5)---(3)---(8)---(9)

    1. Sort first 2/3
    2. Sort last 2/3
    3. Sort first 2/3 again
    4. Repeat recursively

/*
Time Complexity:
- Worst, Average, and Best Case: O(n^(log 3 / log 1.5)) â‰ˆ O(n^2.7095)

Space Complexity:
- O(log n) due to the recursion stack

Note: Stooge Sort is primarily of theoretical interest and is not used in practice
due to its poor time complexity. It's less efficient than even simple algorithms.
